# VS Code Markdown Auto Preview

Automatically opens the Markdown Preview when you open a Markdown file.

## Features

- **Auto Preview**: Automatically opens the preview pane when you open a `.md` file or switch to it.
- **Smart Toggle**: Status Bar buttons allow easy switching between Source `$(code)` and Preview `$(preview)`.
- **Loop Prevention**: Intelligently handles navigation so you can view the source code when you need to, without being forced back to preview immediately.
- **Open Source Button**: Easily switch back to the source code from the preview using the Status Bar button.

## Usage

1. Open any Markdown file. The preview will open automatically.
2. Double-click the tab to view the source code.
3. Use the `$(preview) Open Preview` button in the Status Bar to switch back to preview.
4. Use the `$(code) Open Source` button in the Status Bar (while in preview) to switch back to source.
